Mitaka's Minability: A Review of how Lightcurve Analysis Can Be Used to Find Mineable Asteroids
Observational Per: January, 2023 to March 2023

Asteroid mining is an exciting possible method with which to gain access to new materials for human use, on and off of Earth.
Minerals valuable on Earth may be able to be found in larger quantities on asteroids and sent back to Earth by private companies, however the introduction of this new material will inevitably cause a drop in the price of any minerals brought to Earth to the large influx of yet before unreachable sources.
Another possibility is to use the material mined off of asteroids in-situ to create more mining craft in space, and create the beginnings of human civilisation away from Earth.
1088 Mitaka was observed in order to test a simpler method of screening asteroids as mining candidates than using high resolution imaging that may require satellites.
By observing the variance of the brightness of Mitaka in time, and lightcurve (LC) can be formed, and by analysing the LC the period of Mitaka can be found, $P_w = 0.1264707842 \pm 1\times10^{-10}days$.
Then using the LC and the period, a convex hull can be modelled by fitting the LC of the model to that of Mitaka.
The shape of Mitaka can be assessed for its appropriateness for mining.
Then the material area of two cross-sections of Mitaka can be found $A_\alpha=(300 \pm 60)\times10^6 m^2$ and $A_\Omega = (500\pm 600)\times10^6 m^2$.
The volume can then be approximated from the calculated areas $V_w = 8000 \pm 13100 Km^3$, and by comparison to the average density of other S-types,$\rho_S = 3000 \pm 900 Kg m^{-3}$, the mass can be approximated $m_w = (2 \pm 4)\times10^{13} Kg$.
Lastly, by comparison to the average fractional mass of minerals in S-types, $Z$, the approximate amount of a mineral in Mitaka can be found, e.g.
$m^w_{Fe,Ni} = (7\pm10)\E{12} Kg$.
